        <h1>SunoPromptGenerator User Manual</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>
<h3>1.1. What is the SunoPromptGenerator (AI Music Studio)?</h3>
<p>Welcome to the SunoPromptGenerator, also known as the AI Music Studio. This advanced tool is designed to bridge the gap between your favorite audio tracks and the creative potential of AI-powered music generation. It acts as a musical analyst, listening to an audio file, understanding its core components, and translating them into detailed text prompts that you can use with the Suno music generation API.</p>
<h3>1.2. Core Purpose & Key Concepts</h3>
<p>The primary goal of the SunoPromptGenerator is to automate the complex process of describing a song's style, mood, and structure. Instead of manually trying to put the "vibe" of a song into words, this tool does the heavy lifting for you. It analyzes an audio file to extract its fundamental musical and lyrical characteristics, enabling you to create new, original music that is thematically and musically inspired by a reference track.</p>
<h3>1.3. Who is this manual for?</h3>
<p>This manual is for anyone interested in creating AI-generated music, especially those who want to guide the AI with the style of an existing song. It is written for a non-technical audience, so you don't need a background in music theory or software development to get started.</p>
<hr>

<ul>
<li><strong>5.1.1. Tempo (BPM) Detection:</strong> Measures the speed of the music in Beats Per Minute.</li>
<li><strong>5.1.2. Musical Key and Mode:</strong> Determines the track's key (e.g., C, G#, F) and mode (Major or minor).</li>
<li><strong>5.1.3. Energy Classification:</strong> Analyzes the track's loudness (RMS value) to classify it as "low," "medium," or "high" energy.</li>
<li><strong>5.1.4. Mood Inference:</strong> Combines tempo, key, and energy to infer the overall mood, such as "Energetic," "Melancholic," or "Calm."</li>
<li><strong>5.1.5. Automatic Genre Classification:</strong> A smart, rule-based engine identifies the genre from a large library, with a special focus on electronic music.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5.2. Vocal and Lyric Processing</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>5.2.1. How Vocal Separation Works (<code>demucs</code>):</strong> The application uses Meta's high-fidelity <code>demucs</code> model to cleanly separate the vocal track from the instruments.</li>
<li><strong>5.2.2. Lyric Transcription with Whisper:</strong> The isolated vocal track is then transcribed into text using OpenAI's <code>Whisper</code> model.</li>
<li><strong>5.2.3. Vocal Gender Detection:</strong> By analyzing the pitch of the separated vocals, the tool suggests whether the lead singer is "Male" or "Female."</li>
</ul>
<h3>5.3. Understanding the Generated Prompts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>5.3.1. Basic & Detailed Prompts:</strong> Simple, comma-separated lists of the core musical attributes.</li>

<h2>Chapter 7: Troubleshooting and FAQ</h2>
<h3>7.1. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Why is the analysis so slow?"</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Vocal separation and lyric transcription are very demanding tasks. Performance depends heavily on your computer's hardware. Using an NVIDIA GPU will result in a dramatic speed increase. If you don't have one, the process will take longer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Why was the genre detected incorrectly?"</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Genre detection is complex and subjective. Our rule-based engine is very capable but may not always be perfect. If you find the genre is wrong, you can easily override it by selecting the correct one from the genre list before running the analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"How can I improve lyric transcription accuracy?"</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the configuration panel, select a larger "Whisper Model" (e.g., <code>medium</code> or <code>large</code>). Larger models are significantly more accurate but require more processing time and computer memory.</p>
<h3>7.2. Common Errors and Solutions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>7.2.1. Installation Issues:</strong> Ensure you have followed all steps in the <code>README.md</code> file and have installed all required dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>7.2.2. API Connection Errors:</strong> Double-check that you have entered your Suno API key correctly and that you have a stable internet connection.</li>
<li><strong>7.2.3. Errors during Audio Analysis:</strong> Some audio files may be corrupt or in an unsupported format. Try converting the file to a standard format like <code>.mp3</code> or <code>.wav</code> and try again.</li>
</ul>
